	abstract = {The evolution of new battery technologies and unique system requirements has created a demand for intelligent power electronic battery-charger solutions. This paper will present a method showing how to develop a programmable solution that supports multiple topologies and hardware designs that can be used to safely and reliability charge existing and future battery chemistries, in addition to super-capacitor energy storage needs. Common and popular battery-charger topologies, such as Buck, Flyback, {SEPIC} and Cuk', will be used as examples. Using this method, accurate constant voltage and charge current can be achieved with all topologies via a common firmware platform and a highly integrated hybrid {PWM} controller.},
